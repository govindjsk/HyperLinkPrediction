function [Lambda,scores,hlpredicted] = HLpredict(hltrain,hltest,num_prediction,method,ith_experiment,test_labels)
%  Usage: A wrapper for different hyperlink prediction methods.
%         Call [Lambda,scores] = HLpredict(hltrain,hltest,num_prediction) to run in default mode.
%  --Input--
%  -hltrain: existing training hyperlinks, each row is a vertex, each column is a hyperlink. 
%           hltrain(i,j)==1 iff vertex i is in hyperlink j.
%  -hltest: the candidate hyperlinks, same format as hltrain
%  -num_prediction: how many number of hyperlinks to select as predictions
%  -method: 'CMM'--the Coordinated Matrix Minimization algorithm, default. 
%
%  -ith_experiment: a positive integer number indicating you are running the ith experiment 
%           (for parallelly running multiple experiments purpose, avoid file reading conflict)
%  -test_labels: the labels of hltest, used for showing intermediate results within an algorithm
%  --Output--
%  -Lambda: logical column indicator vector, Lambda(i)==1 iff hltest(:,i) is predicted as positive (0 otherwise)
%  -scores: column vector of prediction scores of hltest, higher means more likely to be positive
%  -hlpredicted: the predicted hyperlinks, same format as hltrain
